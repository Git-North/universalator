This is a fork of https://github.com/nanonestor/universalator 
The main difference between the original and this fork is that this fork uses a different java distribution (amazon coretto for LTS and Azul Zulu for Java 11)
The reasoning for that is Adoptium's java lacks certain features which are needed for certain mods while also having an inferior garbage collector. This fork tries to solve that problem by using different java distributions.
